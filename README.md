# chat_app - Flutter

## Get started.
This is a chat app that i made with pure Flutter , I used Firebase as backend to handle and store all messages and user's data . 
Also this is one of my initial projects while in the journy of learning Flutter , so this app is not perfect and might have some issues and bugs ,but i have learned many things by doing this one . Also i learned how to work with Firebase  and some other cool packages such as Lottie .
